# Image-Segmentation
Partitioning the image into segments by understanding the image scene via a graph theoritical approach. An implementation of [Normalized Cuts and Image Segmentation][1] by Jianbo Shi and Jitendra Malik

Some sample outputs are shown below. The left most picture indicates the original image or input. The image to the right of that display the partitions obtained from the algorithm
